As I am a fanatic of hamburgers I decided to create a website for a hamburger restaurant. The website serves for the customer to know the history behind the creation of the restaurant, our menu with prices and another section where you can find our opening hours, location and contact.

In addition the customer also has a gallery where he can see each dish of our menu. Finally as it is a new restaurant I have created a form to get feedback from people and return them a free burger. The form serves to attract customers and to improve the quality of the restaurant.

## User experience - UX

### User Stories
- As the creator of the website I want to design a website that allows the client to have a presence on the internet and at the same time let regular and new customers know about the restaurant and its updates.

- As a new visitor, I want to get to know the restaurant, see its dishes, contact information, location and opening hours.

- As a regular visitor I want to be kept up to date with news and have a telephone and email available for booking.

## Design

### Website Structure

The Last Hamburger website is a three-page site: Home, Gallery and Free Burger. The default loading page is Home (index.html). The home page has 4 sections: (1) an introductory video, (2) Our History, (3) Menu, (4) Contact. The Home page is linked to all pages of the website via the navigation menu at the top. The Gallery has photos showing the restaurant's dishes and some photos of the restaurant itself.  The Free Burger page is a form to receive feedback from customers. Each page is linked to all the pages of the website via the navigation menu at the top and all have the Footer.

### Colour Scheme

The #000000 has been used for the background and #ECEFF1 for the text. And the colour #D32F2F has been used to mark the form and also for the "Hover" function.

### Typography
Montserrat is used for titles and Crimson Pro is used for the rest of the website.

### Photos

6 images have been used in the Our History section, 12 images in the Gallery and 1 background image on the Free Burger page. 

### Videos

The Landing Page has one video as a background displaying muted, loop and autoplay.

### Google Maps

The web site has a Google Maps location section where the users can locate the restaurant in Valencia, Spain.

## Bugs

  - The Lighthouse test has given a negative result on mobile and desktop performance. The problem has been solved by optimising the images and the video. TinyPNG has been used for the images and Videosmaller for the video. The path to the HTML files has also been changed. Below you can see the results of Lighthouse on desktop and mobile:

As I am a fanatic of hamburgers I decided to create a website for a hamburger restaurant. The website serves for the customer to know the history behind the creation of the restaurant, our menu with prices and another section where you can find our opening hours, location and contact.

In addition the customer also has a gallery where he can see each dish of our menu. Finally as it is a new restaurant I have created a form to get feedback from people and return them a free burger. The form serves to attract customers and to improve the quality of the restaurant.
